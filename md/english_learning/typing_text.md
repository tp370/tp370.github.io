# day 1

I wake up early in the morning.
The sun is shinning, and the sky is blue.
I brush my teeth and wash my face.
Then I eat breakfast with my family.
After that, I go to my room and start my work.
I like to read books and learn new things.
Every day is a good day to learn something new.

I enjoy coding every day.
My name is Li Qinghe. 
Learning English is fun. 
Touch typing will make you faster.
